- 👋 Hi, I’m @vinkihuang
- 👀 I’m interested in reading, eating, C++ing, Pythoning, (sometimes)Scratching.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on no one at present.
- 📫 How to reach me : email vinkihuang@outlook.com or vinkihuang@aliyun.com or vinkihuang@163.com or vinkihuang@yeah.net or vinkihuang@dingtalk.com or 3664043499@qq.com (PS ONLY USE THE FIRST TWO EMAILS, OR BETTER, THE FIRST EMAIL.)
- 😄 Pronouns: Scratch is a person with no limbs. Python is a kind, over-active and over-worked person. C++ is a cold-blooded and cruel assassinator.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an excessive amount of emails.
